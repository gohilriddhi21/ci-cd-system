### What Worked This Week?

- **Tech Stack Updates:** Adding the libraries (Picocli, Apache Commons CLI, and Regex) to the Tech Stack document
  helped the team narrow down the best options for argument parsing. The review and comparison of these libraries
  allowed for informed decisions on which libraries to use, based on ease of use and coding style preferences.
- **Weekly Meetings:** Scheduling next week's meetings helped keep everyone aligned and ensured clear communication
  across the team.

### What Did Not Work This Week?

- Integration testing
- **Task Modulation:** Some tasks were more complex than initially thought, resulting in their carryover to the next
  sprint. We'll need to improve task estimation and breakdown for smoother execution in the future.

### Design Updates

- Updated the Tech Stack document based on the requested changes from Professor and the team.
