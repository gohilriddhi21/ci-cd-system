## What Worked This Week?

- **Scheduled Weekly Meetings:** Having a fixed time for team meetings (every Wednesday at 4:00 PM) helped in aligning
  everyone's schedules and ensuring consistent communication.
- **Repo Structure Setup:** Setting up the repository structure early in the project provided a clear foundation for
  organizing code and documentation.
- **Documentation Creation:** Creating the Tech Stack, High-Level Architecture, and Team Process documents early ensured
  that everyone had a shared understanding of the project's direction and processes.

## What Did Not Work This Week?

- **Task Modulation:** Better task breakdown and estimation are needed for future sprints.
