### What Worked This Week?

- **Successful Implementation of --dry-run and --run commands:** The core execution functionality of the CLI was implemented, allowing us to run pipelines and perform dry runs.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:** We successfully created GitHub Actions workflows to automate testing and validation.
- **Validation Improvements:** The validator return value was updated to improve error reporting, making debugging easier.

### What Did Not Work This Week?

- **Test Coverage Gaps:** The test cases for -c and -f commands were delayed, leading to lower test coverage than expected.


### Design Updates

- None
